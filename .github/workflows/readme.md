There are several potential risks associated with this Git workflow, which are as follows:

1. Reacting to push on the main branch

This workflow reacts to changes pushed to the main branch. This suggests that if a team member accidentally pushes code to the main branch, the code will be automatically built, tested, and deployed. Instead, developers should create a branch, make a pull request, and merge it into the main branch after it has been reviewed.

2. Insufficient code verification

This workflow builds code using the make command, but lacks other verification methods. For example, running a test suite can help identify issues related to code functionality and performance. Code reviews and adherence to style guides are also important. Adding these steps to the workflow can help maintain code quality and identify issues.

3. Code safety is not guaranteed

This workflow only builds C/C++ code and does not perform security-related verifications, such as vulnerability scanning or checking for updated dependencies. C/C++ programs have vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, integer overflow, and memory leaks. In particular, for open-source projects, there is a risk that malicious users may inject vulnerabilities into the code, so security concerns should be considered.

4. Commented-out steps remain in the workflow

This workflow includes commented-out steps. While these steps may have been intended for deletion for some reason, leaving them commented out can cause confusion. Commented-out code should be removed to avoid ambiguity.
