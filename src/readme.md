## There are several potential issues with this program:

1. Incorrect handling of thread function return values: The return value of the thread function thread_func() is of type void*, but this program returns an integer value, which is cast to a pointer type and then cast back to an integer when pthread_join() is called. However, this cast is incorrect, and casting from void* to an integer type can result in undefined behavior. The correct approach is to design thread_func() to return a pointer type and return the result using pthread_exit().

2. Lack of exception handling between pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock(): If sub1() throws an exception, pthread_mutex_unlock() will not be called, and the lock will never be released. This can potentially cause a deadlock if other threads are waiting for the same lock.

3. sub1() function may return -1, which is treated as a normal exit value. pthread_join() expects the thread to set the return value using pthread_exit() to confirm the normal exit of the thread. If a thread exits with an error, the return value should be set to an error code like -1.

4. sub1() and sub2() functions are called while the lock is held. This can prevent other threads from executing and can cause a performance slowdown if other threads are waiting for the lock. If it is safe to call sub1() and sub2() without the lock held, it is desirable to release the lock before calling them.

To address these issues, thread_func() needs to be redesigned to return the correct type of value using pthread_exit(), exception handling needs to be added between pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock(), and the lock needs to be released before calling sub1() and sub2().
